        <h1>Farewell to Citrus Cafe: A Tustin Favorite Closes</h1>
       <h2>Local Restaurant to be Replaced by a Car Wash</h2>

     <p>After decades of serving the community, the beloved Citrus Cafe in Tustin, California,
        has closed its doors for the last time.  Known for its welcoming atmosphere and delicious menu,
        the cafe was a staple for locals who appreciated its cozy setting and friendly service.</p>
    
     <p>Despite community support, rising costs and redevelopment pressures led to the decision to close. 
        The space will soon be transformed into a car wash, which has resulted in mixed reactions among residents.
    <em>One local business owner remarked</em>, <q>The character of our city is changing, and while progress
        is inevitable, it's sad to see places with history disappear.</q></p>
    
     <p>While Citrus Cafe may be gone, its legacy lives on in the memories of those who dined there. 
        As Tustin continues to evolve, many hope that new businesses will embrace the community spirit
        that Citrus Cafe once represented.</p>
